The Budgeteer

This program will enable the user to be fully in control of his finacial
situation. It allows the user to enter his income, and all his expenditures. Due
to the accessible scheme, it will be easy for the user to see what he is spending 
and due to the categorization of the expenses, the user is reminded of what he 
normally forgets to include in his administration. The user will be able to enter 
his budget for several subcategories of expenditures and the site will check if
the user sticks to his budget. Also a savings helper will be included, which helps
the user to save a certain amount of money. Diagrams will give an oversight 
of the users financial situation.

Features
- Financial administration Caculator
- Budget indicator

This program will be implemented with Ruby on Rails and will be using
a database to remember users and ther budgeting decisions.
